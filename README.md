Overview of the Project
Project: Student Grade Management System 
Objective: The objective of this project is to develop a simple console-based student management system that allows users to add student records, assign grades, calculate average grades, and display individual student performance. The system utilizes a class-based design and stores student objects in a dictionary for efficient data retrieval and management.

Key Activities:
Adding a Student Record: The user can add a new student by providing a name, which is used to create a Student object and store it in a dictionary.
Adding Grades for a Student: The program allows users to input grades for a specified student, ensuring that the grades are valid (between 0 and 100). Input validation prevents erroneous data entry.
Viewing Student Performance: Users can retrieve and display a list of grades for any student, along with their average grade, rounded to two decimal places.
Error Handling and User Interaction: The program includes input validation for numeric grades and provides error messages for invalid inputs or unknown student names.

Technologies Used: 
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the student management system. 
Data Structures: 
Dictionary: Stores student objects with names as keys for quick lookup. 
List: Maintains a collection of grades for each student.

Features: 
Input Validation: Ensures grades are numeric and within the range of 0 to 100. User-Friendly Interface: Provides a menu-driven interface for seamless navigation. 
Dynamic Data Handling: Easily handles an unlimited number of students and grades within the memory constraints. 
Average Calculation: Implements a function to compute and display the average grade.
